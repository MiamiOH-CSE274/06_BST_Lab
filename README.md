==============

Implement a binary search tree in C++

Requirements
------------

1. All methods except the destructor and `size()` should be O(h), where h is the height of the tree
2. `size()` should be O(n)

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 6, the entire chapter. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_Binary_Trees.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. all methods besides the constructor and size use recursion to navigate the tree to find the node it needs.  because of this, the average case for each method should be O(h).
2. size() must look at every element in the tree to determine the size, therefor it is O(n).

#### 2. Do exercises 6.7 and 6.9 on http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_3_Discussion_Exercises.html. Keep in mind: You do NOT need to write real working code, you may write pseudo-code. In fact, that is preferred.

6.7)

	function pre_order_number(node, number):
	 if node is null then return

	 node.number = number
	 pre_order_number(node.left, number + 1)
	 pre_order_number(node.right, number + 1)
	end function
	 
	function in_order_number(node, number):
	 if node is null then return

	 in_order_number(node.left, number + 1)
	 node.number = number
	 in_order_number(node.right, number + 1)
	end function

	function post_order_number(node, number):
	 if node is null then return

	 post_order_number(node.left, number + 1)
	 post_order_number(node.right, number + 1)
	 node.number = number
	end function

6.9)  I found these 3 questions to be pretty difficult.  the answers I give work for the 3 example trees in figure 6.10 in the reading, but im not entirely sure if they always work.

1)

	given node u, determine size of subtree rooted at u:
		node temp = max(u)
		
		return temp.pre - u.pre + 1
2)
	
	given node u, determine depth of subtree rooted at u:
		node temp = max(u)
		
		if temp = u then
			// this means there were no nodes to the right
			temp = min(u)
		
		// at this point, temp will either be the largest node to the right
		// of u, the largest node to the left if there are no right nodes, or
		// u if u is a leaf
		return u.post - temp.post + 1
3)

	given nodes w and u, determine if u is an ancestor of w:
		if w.pre > u.pre and w.post < u.post then
			return true
		return false

#### 3. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?
