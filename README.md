==============

Implement a binary search tree in C++

Requirements
------------

1. All methods except the destructor and `size()` should be O(h), where h is the height of the tree

2. `size()` should be O(n)

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 6, the entire chapter. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_Binary_Trees.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. Looks good. I'm not 100% certain but I'm pretty sure.
2. This I'm sure about...size is straightforward.  Cool stuff!

#### 2. Do exercises 6.7 and 6.9 on http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_3_Discussion_Exercises.html. Keep in mind: You do NOT need to write real working code, you may write pseudo-code. In fact, that is preferred.



#### 3. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?

I...I'm not sure how I'm supposed to think some of this stuff up on my own.  I'm very good at looking at someone elses code and copying/implementing their processes but bad at coming up with it.
