==============

Implement a binary search tree in C++

Requirements
------------

1. All methods except the destructor and `size()` should be O(h), where h is the height of the tree
2. `size()` should be O(n)

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 6, the entire chapter. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_Binary_Trees.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. TODO
2. I think size() is working and runs in O(n) time because it traverses the whole tree in order to count the nodes.  Since it visits every node, it will run in linear time.  If the number of nodes doubles, the running time will double since it visits all of them.

#### 2. Do exercises 6.7 and 6.9 on http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_3_Discussion_Exercises.html. Keep in mind: You do NOT need to write real working code, you may write pseudo-code. In fact, that is preferred.

#### 3. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?
